# Smart-Criminal-Record-Management-System
A Software Project management On Smart Criminal Record Tracker
### Problem Statement
In the existing criminal record system all the work is done manually, we can access 
the details in a particular record only after a tiring search of all the records in the 
police stations in a particular state, which is mostly performed manually and stored 
variably. This system needs more manpower to track the records of the crimes and 
criminals behind it. This adds to the workload of authorized persons. Managing all 
the records, updating and maintaining them as a consolidated document becomes a 
tough task and at times essential details could be missed out due to human error. 
Retrieving old criminal records consumes more time. In the existing system all 
work is done on papers so it is very tough to secure and maintain criminal report 
data
